# react-whiteboard

## TODO

For this project we are using the [swapi public API](https://swapi.co/).

- [ ] Modularise the existing app creating a Component for the logo
- [ ] Update the `CharacterCard` component to make it look like the provided design
- [ ] Introduce the notion of Layout so we don't have to copy/paste the `Header` on every `Page`
- [ ] Add loader while fetching the data using `react-content-loader`
- [ ] Introduce some animations to display the characters on the page

It should take you between 30 to 40 minutes to do so.

- You have a [sketch version available here](https://github.com/TheRocketLab/react-whiteboard-frontend/blob/master/docs/demo.sketch)
