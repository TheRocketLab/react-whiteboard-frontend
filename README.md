# react-whiteboard

## TODO

For this project we are using a local API using `json-server` running on http://localhost:3004 when starting react app.

- [ ] Update the `LeagueSection` and `TeamCard` component to make it look like the provided design
- [ ] Introduce animations to display the teams on the page with the library of you choice
- [ ] Modularise the existing app creating a Component for the logo
- [ ] Introduce the notion of Layout so we don't have to copy/paste the `Header` on every `Page`
- [ ] Add loader while fetching the data using `react-content-loader`

It should take you between 30 to 40 minutes to do so.
